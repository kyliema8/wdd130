<h2>What is Furniture Flipping?</h2>
<p>Furniture flipping is all about taking second-hand, often discarded, pieces and giving them new life with a combination of creativity, skill, and effort. It involves:

    Finding hidden gems: Scouring thrift stores, garage sales, and marketplaces for potential pieces.
    Restoring & Repairing: Sanding, painting, and fixing anything that’s worn, damaged, or outdated.
    Designing: Re-imagining furniture with new colors, textures, and styles to fit modern tastes.
    Selling or Reusing: Once restored, the pieces are either sold for a profit, donated, or used in your own home.
    Whether you're flipping furniture as a hobby, looking to make some extra income, or starting a full-fledged furniture business, we’re here to help you every step of the way.</p>
    <h3>Why Choose Furniture Flipping?</h3>
